= NIX-CONFIG =

I used NIX for 2 purposes:

1. to configure my host MacOS
2. to configure a Linux VM for my development work and as much other work as I can get away with as I don't like the 
MacOS Desktop Experience, although I love the hardware(M2).


== Installation ==

1. Download NixOS minimal ISO from https://nixos.org/download
2.
